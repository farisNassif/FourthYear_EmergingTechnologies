~Give a brief rundown of what is asked from the project<br>
~Outline of work eg. 'Create web app, users can draw on the page, submit the drawing and see if it's recognised'<br>
~How to run the project and it's requirements<br>
~Training the model<br>
~Accuracy of the model<br>
~Screenshots or a gif showing the project in action<br>
~Problems in the project<br>
~What I would change<br>
~Conclusion<br>

**TODO
clean up code majorly
have the drawn image saved or output or something
once thats done have it predicted
add comments 
add research notes
fix up canvas
make it work on any touch screen device
