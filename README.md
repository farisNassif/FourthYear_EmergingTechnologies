~How to run the project and it's requirements<br>
~Training the model<br>
~Accuracy of the model<br>
~Screenshots or a gif showing the project in action<br>
~Problems in the project<br>
~What I would change<br>
~Conclusion<br>

**TODO
clean up code majorly
have the drawn image saved or output or something
once thats done have it predicted
